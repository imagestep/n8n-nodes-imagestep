 * resolves its `op` value.

 * Generated, not typed (#571): `static-ops.json` is the committed catalogue (`apps/service/openapi/ops.json`) cut to
 * the job ops and their op / kind / description, written by `scripts/static-ops.mjs`. A hand-kept copy drifted twice —
 * `render_template` missing (#94), descriptions that were not the catalogue's — and the repo root's
 * `test/ops-catalogue.test.js` is red when the file no longer matches `ops.json`.
